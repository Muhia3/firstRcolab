Generation of random numbers and application of simulation using r programming
Plot a histogram of the means of the samples generated in part (a), using an appropriate option in R for plotting the histogram on the probability density scale.
Plot the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the sampling distribution of the sample 
Mean ,under the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), corresponding to the samples
generated in part (a). The graph of the PDF should be superimposed on the histogram produced in part
